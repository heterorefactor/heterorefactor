# HeteroRefactor (icse2020-artifacts)
Artifacts submission for ICSE 2020.

## Prerequisites

HeteroRefactor has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. The following packages are required to be installed. We list them as Ubuntu package names. If you are using another operating system, please check the these package names accordingly.

```bash
sudo apt-get install gawk git wget tar bzip2 gcc automake autoconf \
    libhpdf-dev libc6-dev autotools-dev bison flex libtool libbz2-dev \
    libpython2.7-dev ghostscript libhpdf-dev libmpfrc++-dev \
    build-essential time perl-doc man-db
```

To get the resource utilization results for the original and refactored kernels, a valid Xilinx Vivado license is required to do the FPGA synthesis and implementation. Please make sure they are in your `PATH` environment variable, and you can run `vivado` and `vivado_hls` in your terminal.

We made some modifications on the library that is shipped with your Vivado installation to get / reproduce the results for floating-point kernels. Due to copyright issues, we cannot release the modified code in public. This library will be available upon request if you have a valid license. Please send an email to Jason Lau \<<lau@cs.ucla.edu>\> along with a screenshot of the license screen of your Vivado installation. We will reply with the code and instructions as soon as possible we receive and verify the request.

## How to build the HeteroRefactor tool

Simply `make`! If you only want to build the tool without running tests:

```
cd heterorefactor; make
```

Alternatively, you can build all the required libraries:

```bash
cd heterorefactor/libraries; make
```

Then build the refactoring tool:

```bash
cd heterorefactor/refactoring; make
```

You can add `-j 16` option to the `make` command for faster building. Adjust the
number `16` to match your core numbers on your system.

## How to Use HeteroRefactor

After building the system, the tool `heterorefactor` is available at `heterorefactor/refactoring/build/heterorefactor`. Please note that we hardcoded a relative path to avoid you explicitly specifying the root path of this project. Therefore, please do not move the binary file. Optionally, you can add `heterorefactor/refactoring/build/` to your `PATH`.

To use the tool, please type

```bash
heterorefactor [-int/-fp/-rec/-instrument] \
    -I path/your/include/files [...and other GCC compiler options] \
    -u refactored_output_code.cpp \
    input_code.cpp
```

For example, if you want to refactor the linked list kernel using HeteroRefactor and output to `output.cpp`:

```bash
heterorefactor -rec -u output.cpp experiments/Recursive/ll/src/kernel.cpp
```
Please check `heterorefactor -h` for a detailed manual. You can also see more detailed usage, including how to obtain and use the invariants, in each experiment folder.

## How to Reproduce Paper Results

See `README.md` files under `experiments/FP`, `experiments/Integer` and `experiments/Recursive`.
